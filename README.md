### Project Outcomes

### Recommendations
1. Future Planning and Decision-making
   - Pennsylvania is most preferred location
   - Given clear seasonal patterns, especially in provinces like California and Texas, our client can align their sales and marketing strategies to coincide with peak            periods.
   - Since California and Texas are showing the steepest growth trajectories, they might be ideal candidates for further investment in terms of marketing, infrastructure,         and other resources.
   - With the forecasts available, our client can prepare for potential troughs or downtrends by diversifying offerings or running promotions.
   - While forecasts provide a guideline, it's crucial to continuously monitor actual sales against forecasts to adjust strategies accordingly.
2. Business process optimisation
   - Implement workflow automation tools and software to reduce manual, time-consuming tasks.
   - Enhance efficiency, reduce backorders, and satisfy customers by reviewing supplier contracts for cost-saving opportunities.
   - Ensure that inventory levels are optimised to meet demand.
   - Optimise the supply chain by reducing lead times, minimising shipping costs, and optimising inventory.
   - Listen to customer feedback and adjust your processes to better meet their needs.
